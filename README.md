# spsymp2019
The repository contains the main.m script, which shows the usage of the techniques introduced in the SpSymp2019 paper by Marcin Kuropatwi≈Ñski. Running the program of the repo requires MATLAB base and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.
The main.m scripts ilustrates graphically the process of learning the region of high probability of a Gaussian Mixture Model. It displays also a progress bar, which gives prediction of the ETA.

For the documentation of the subfunctions called by the main.m script consult their help sections.
